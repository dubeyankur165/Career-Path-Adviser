<h1>Career Recommendation System</h1>

For college students when facing various career options upon graduation or at any phase of learning, it could be overwhelming to choose a job that better fits with his/her future goals. 
This is when people start to look for other people who have similar backgrounds to see what their decisions were and where did they end up. Instead of consulting only a few acquaintances, we present a way to help people learn from thousands of others with similar backgrounds and find the best career steps that enable them to reach their goals

<h2>Description of Proposed System:</h2>

The first phase of the system namely the prediction stage involves the development of a classifier by extracting unique values of individual employee profile has been extracted and frequencies have been calculated based on various attributes.

The second phase namely the recommendation stage recommends the user with its predicted career which is possibly attained with the help of highest accuracy obtained through various algorithms which must be carried after the user enters his personal details.

<h2> The main objective of this project is given below:</h2> 
  
• User enters various details about subject interests.

• Based on the user inputs and after analysis of the information, the user can view a detailed report on the best suited courses and career options for them along with detailed description for each recommendation. 

• Students get a better understanding about exactly how and where they fit.

• The application provides a comprehensive guide to the users, as to what they would be a good fit for and what other resources they need to ensure that they are even a better fit.

• Assists and provides more information to users about the field they may be good at, which makes choosing a field of study easier.
